# Memory Game - Fruity Fruit Match

A fruit themed memory card game that requires the user to find 2 of the same matching cards in order to gain a point. A timer counting down from 60 seconds is included to provide a challenge. If the timer hits 0 and the player hasn't completed the game, they are prompted with a game over screen and can replay. Furthermore, the players clicks are tracked in order to allow the user to analyse how well they are doing. The fewer clicks the better.
