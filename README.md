# Memory Game - Fruity Fruit Match

A fruit themed memory card game that requires the user to find 2 of the same matching cards in order to gain a point. A timer counting down from 60 seconds is included to provide a challenge. If the timer hits 0 and the player hasn't completed the game, they are prompted with a game over screen and can replay. Furthermore, the players clicks are tracked in order to allow the user to analyse how well they are doing. The fewer clicks the better. 

# Target Audience

# Planning

Before I began coding, I did some planning. Important such as layout and game play needed to be decided on before I moved on to coding. Having a plan allowed me to always refer back to my plan once I'd completed one major aspect.
