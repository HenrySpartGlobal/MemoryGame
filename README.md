# Memory Game - Fruity Fruit Match

A fruit themed memory card game that requires the user to find 2 of the same matching cards in order to gain a point. A timer counting down from 60 seconds is included to provide a challenge. If the timer hits 0 and the player hasn't completed the game, they are prompted with a game over screen and can replay. Furthermore, the players clicks are tracked in order to allow the user to analyse how well they are doing. The fewer clicks the better. The game is very simple, click two cards and try to find the two matching numbers! 

# Target Audience

# Planning

Before I began coding, I did some planning. Important elements such as layout and gameplay needed to be decided on before I moved on to development. Having a plan allowed me to always refer back to my plan once one major aspect was completed.

# Credits 

It's about time to mention resources (and people behind them) that helped me to create my game.
