# Target Audience : 

BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE GAME - memory card game...


The game is suitable for everyone to play,
but because the colour scheme, game theme and sounds its MORE targeted for a young audience 

How to play: 

You click two cards and find a match. 

Mechanics: 

Your clicks are tracked, so when you play again you can attempt to beat your score.

there is a timer, 

counting down from 30seconds so the game is not too easy. 

Biggest challenge: 

-  shuffling function looping, couldnt finish game 

- fixed by console logging array, seeing that they kept shuffling and fixed it from there (move function into a right bracket)


Progress Photos: 

These are images of the styling development, over the week. 

- decided on a theme later on 

- the simplicity of the game natrually called for a young target audience 


Improvements I would make: 

Create 3 seperate game difficulties, easy medium and hard. 

Each would increase the amount of cards on the deck and decrease the timer 

- Card flip animations
